# VibeCert SQLite Migration Summary

## Overview

Successfully migrated VibeCert from file-based storage to SQLite database storage with enhanced functionality and improved certificate management capabilities.

## Migration Accomplishments

### ✅ Database Schema Implementation
- **Certificates Table**: Stores certificate metadata with serial number as primary key
  - Issuer, Subject, validity period stored in dedicated fields for efficient querying
  - Complete X.509 PEM data stored as text blob
  - Certificate type flags (is_ca, is_root, is_self_signed)
  - Links to private keys via SHA256 public key hash

- **Keys Table**: Stores encrypted private keys
  - SHA256 hash of public key as primary key
  - Encrypted PEM data stored as text blob
  - Secure linkage to certificates

### ✅ New Commands Implemented

#### Import Commands
- `vibecert import --cert <file> [--key <file>]`
  - Import certificates with or without private keys
  - Automatic public key hash calculation and storage
  - Graceful handling of certificates without keys

#### Export Commands
- `vibecert export-cert --serial <serial> [--output <file>]`
  - Human-readable certificate export (similar to `openssl x509 -text`)
  - Shows certificate details, validity, extensions, and PEM data

- `vibecert export-key --serial <serial> [--output <file>]`
  - Export encrypted private keys
  - Maintains original encryption and format

- `vibecert reencrypt-key --serial <serial>`
  - Change private key passwords interactively
  - Prompts for current password, new password, and confirmation
  - Updates database with re-encrypted key

#### Enhanced PKCS#12 Export
- `vibecert export-pkcs12 --serial <serial> [--output <file>] [--name <name>] [--include-ca]`
  - Reworked to use database storage
  - Automatic CA certificate chain collection from database
  - Compatible with original functionality

### ✅ Preserved Legacy Commands
- `vibecert create-root` - Creates root CA certificates (now stores in DB)
- `vibecert create-intermediate` - Creates intermediate CA certificates
- `vibecert create-leaf` - Creates end-entity certificates
- `vibecert tree` - Enhanced certificate tree visualization

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Design
- **Location**: `data/vibecert.db`
- **Engine**: SQLite 3 with go-sqlite3 driver
- **Security**: Private keys remain encrypted with user passwords
- **Relationships**: Certificates linked to keys via SHA256 public key hash

### Key Features Added
1. **Certificate Serial Number as Primary Key**: Enables direct certificate lookup
2. **Structured Metadata Storage**: Issuer, subject, validity periods in queryable fields
3. **Public Key Hash Linking**: Secure association between certificates and private keys
4. **Enhanced Tree Visualization**: Shows key availability status
5. **Flexible Import/Export**: Support for various certificate formats and sources

### Security Considerations
- Private keys remain encrypted with AES-256-CBC
- Public key hashes provide secure certificate-to-key mapping
- Database stores encrypted key material only
- No plaintext private key data in database

## Migration Benefits

### Improved Query Capabilities
- Direct SQL queries on certificate metadata
- Efficient filtering by issuer, subject, validity period
- Fast certificate lookups by serial number

### Enhanced Management
- Import existing certificate infrastructure
- Export certificates in multiple formats
- Password management for private keys
- Comprehensive certificate chain handling

### Maintained Compatibility
- All original certificate creation workflows preserved
- PKCS#12 export functionality maintained
- Tree visualization enhanced but familiar

## Database Schema Reference

```sql
-- Certificates table
CREATE TABLE certificates (
    serial_number TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    subject TEXT NOT NULL,
    issuer TEXT NOT NULL,
    not_before DATETIME NOT NULL,
    not_after DATETIME NOT NULL,
    pem_data TEXT NOT NULL,
    key_hash TEXT,
    is_self_signed BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    is_root BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    is_ca BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Keys table  
CREATE TABLE keys (
    public_key_hash TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    pem_data TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Testing Results

### ✅ Functional Tests Passed
- Database initialization and schema creation
- Certificate import (with and without keys)
- Certificate tree visualization with proper hierarchy
- Certificate export with human-readable format
- Private key export functionality
- PKCS#12 export with CA chain collection

### ✅ Data Integrity Verified
- Proper NULL handling for certificates without keys
- Correct parent-child relationships in certificate trees
- Accurate certificate metadata extraction and storage
- Secure key-certificate associations via public key hashes

## Migration Process for Existing Installations

For users with existing file-based certificates:

```bash
# Import all existing certificates
for cert in data/certs/*.crt; do
    serial=$(basename "$cert" .crt)
    if [ -f "data/keys/${serial}.key" ]; then
        vibecert import --cert "$cert" --key "data/keys/${serial}.key"
    else
        vibecert import --cert "$cert"
    fi
done
```

## Dependencies Added

- `github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3 v1.14.22` - SQLite database driver

## Future Enhancements Enabled

The new SQLite-based architecture enables:
- Advanced certificate filtering and search
- Certificate expiration monitoring
- Automated certificate renewal workflows  
- Certificate lifecycle management
- Integration with external PKI systems
- Certificate validation and trust chain verification

## Summary

The migration successfully modernizes VibeCert with a robust database backend while maintaining full compatibility with existing workflows. The new import/export capabilities significantly enhance certificate management flexibility, and the SQLite foundation enables future advanced PKI management features.
