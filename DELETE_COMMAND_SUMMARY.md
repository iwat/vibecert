# Delete Command Implementation Summary

## Overview

The `vibecert delete` command provides safe and comprehensive certificate and private key deletion functionality with proper dependency checking, confirmation prompts, and atomic transactions.

## Command Syntax

```bash
vibecert delete --serial <serial_number> [--force]
```

## Parameters

- `--serial <serial_number>` (required): The serial number of the certificate to delete
- `--force` (optional): Skip confirmation prompts for automated operations

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Safe Deletion Process

1. **Certificate Lookup**: Verifies certificate exists and loads metadata
2. **Key Association Check**: Determines if certificate has an associated private key
3. **Information Display**: Shows what will be deleted before confirmation
4. **User Confirmation**: Interactive prompt unless `--force` is used
5. **Dependency Warning**: Alerts if certificate has child certificates
6. **Atomic Transaction**: Ensures either complete success or complete rollback

### ✅ Smart Key Management

- **Shared Key Protection**: Only deletes private keys when no other certificates reference them
- **Key Usage Counting**: Tracks how many certificates use each private key
- **Safe Deletion**: Preserves keys that are still needed by other certificates
- **Referential Integrity**: Maintains database consistency throughout deletion

### ✅ Comprehensive Error Handling

- **Non-existent Certificates**: Proper error message for invalid serial numbers
- **Missing Parameters**: Clear usage instructions when required parameters are missing
- **Database Errors**: Graceful handling of database connectivity issues
- **Transaction Failures**: Automatic rollback on any deletion step failure

### ✅ User Experience Features

- **Interactive Confirmations**: Clear prompts with y/N responses
- **Detailed Information**: Shows certificate subject, serial, and key status
- **Parent Certificate Warnings**: Alerts about potential orphaned certificates
- **Force Mode**: Bypass confirmations for scripted operations
- **Clear Success Messages**: Confirmation of what was deleted

## Implementation Details

### Database Operations

The delete command performs the following database operations in a single transaction:

1. **Certificate Verification**:
   ```sql
   SELECT subject, key_hash FROM certificates WHERE serial_number = ?
   ```

2. **Child Certificate Check**:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM certificates WHERE issuer = ?
   ```

3. **Certificate Deletion**:
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM certificates WHERE serial_number = ?
   ```

4. **Key Usage Check**:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM certificates WHERE key_hash = ?
   ```

5. **Conditional Key Deletion** (only if usage count is 0):
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM keys WHERE public_key_hash = ?
   ```

### Transaction Safety

- Uses SQLite transactions to ensure atomicity
- Automatic rollback on any step failure
- Prevents partial deletions that could corrupt database state
- Maintains referential integrity between certificates and keys

### Security Considerations

- **Confirmation Required**: Default behavior requires user confirmation
- **Force Flag Protection**: `--force` should be used carefully in scripts
- **Audit Trail**: Could be extended to log deletion activities
- **No Recovery**: Deletions are permanent (database backups recommended)

## Usage Examples

### Interactive Deletion
```bash
# Delete with confirmation prompt
vibecert delete --serial 1234567890abcdef
```

### Automated Deletion
```bash
# Delete without prompts (for scripts)
vibecert delete --serial 1234567890abcdef --force
```

### Custom Database
```bash
# Delete from specific database
vibecert --db ./project.db delete --serial 1234567890abcdef
```

## Test Coverage

The delete command has been comprehensively tested for:

- ✅ Basic certificate deletion
- ✅ User cancellation scenarios
- ✅ Private key deletion and preservation
- ✅ Parent certificate dependency warnings
- ✅ Error handling for non-existent certificates
- ✅ Parameter validation
- ✅ Shared key scenarios
- ✅ Transaction atomicity
- ✅ Database consistency
- ✅ Edge cases and special characters

## Expected Behaviors

### Certificate with Private Key
```
Certificate to delete:
  Serial: abc123
  Subject: CN=Server Certificate
  Private key: Yes (will also be deleted)

Are you sure you want to delete this certificate? (y/N): y
✓ Associated private key deleted
✓ Certificate deleted successfully
```

### Certificate without Private Key
```
Certificate to delete:
  Serial: def456
  Subject: CN=External Certificate
  Private key: No

Are you sure you want to delete this certificate? (y/N): y
✓ Certificate deleted successfully
```

### Parent Certificate Warning
```
Certificate to delete:
  Serial: root123
  Subject: CN=Root CA
  Private key: No

Warning: This certificate is a parent to 3 other certificate(s).
Deleting it may leave orphaned certificates in the database.
Continue with deletion anyway? (y/N): y
✓ Certificate deleted successfully
```

### Shared Key Scenario
```
Certificate to delete:
  Serial: shared789
  Subject: CN=Renewed Certificate
  Private key: Yes (will also be deleted)

✓ Private key preserved (used by 2 other certificate(s))
✓ Certificate deleted successfully
```

## Integration with Other Commands

The delete command integrates seamlessly with other VibeCert commands:

- **Tree Command**: Certificates disappear from tree after deletion
- **Import Command**: Can re-import deleted certificates
- **Export Commands**: Fail gracefully when certificate no longer exists
- **PKCS#12 Export**: Handles missing certificates in chains appropriately

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

- **Soft Delete**: Mark as deleted instead of permanent removal
- **Audit Logging**: Record who deleted what and when
- **Bulk Operations**: Delete multiple certificates at once
- **Recovery**: Restore recently deleted certificates
- **Cascade Options**: Automatically delete child certificates

## Summary

The delete command provides a robust, safe, and user-friendly way to remove certificates and their associated private keys from the VibeCert database. It prioritizes data integrity, user safety, and operational transparency while maintaining the flexibility needed for both interactive and automated use cases.
